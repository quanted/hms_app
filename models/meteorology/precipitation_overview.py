    # HMS module description
    description = "Precipitation is one of the main processes in the global hydrological cycle, thus integral for " \
                  "modeling purposes. Precipitation is highly variable and influences vegetation, droughts, floods, " \
                  "and the movement of minerals and chemicals. In agriculture and urban areas, precipitation is the " \
                  "driver in contaminant and nutrient transport in water systems due to runoff. Precipitation data is " \
                  "an integral input for many watershed, air, erosion, and agricultural models as well as climate " \
                  "predicting projects. This data is used to determine flood/drought conditions, hydrologic " \
                  "transportation of contaminants, best management practices, and regulations. Precipitation data is " \
                  "generated through direct observation as well as model simulation."
