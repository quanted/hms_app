    # HMS module description
    description = "A workflow in the context of hydrology and water quality domains refers to a sequence of elemental " \
                  "physical processes to represent a larger physical process.  HMS workflows are built by linking " \
                  "components representing elemental physical processes.   For example, Streamflow workflow consists " \
                  "of linking multiple HMS components such as Precipitation, Surface Runoff, Subsurface Flow, and " \
                  "Stream Flow Routing."
